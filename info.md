Entry React developer TEST
# **Welcome to Scandiweb Junior Developer test assignment!**

Thank you for your interest and time! Since 2003 we have been figuring out what is the minimum skills and knowledge level to be successful at your training and further career at scandiweb.

This test requires showcasing this minimum skill level by completing practical tasks. It helps you to check whether your level is already good to join us as a Junior Developer.

## Overview

This task will put you face-to-face to some common tasks in the world of React development and possibly will get you acknowledged with a bit of new technologies.

You are be expected to fetch data from the GraphQL endpoint and to provide an interface to view and interact with this data. You can find the endpoint [here](https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint), along with instructions on how to launch it.

The solution should get implemented as per design, which is available at [this link](https://www.figma.com/file/MSyCAqVy1UgNap0pvqH6H3/Junior-Frontend-Test-Designs-Public?node-id=0%3A1).
